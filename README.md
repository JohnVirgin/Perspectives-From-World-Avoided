# Perspectives-From-World-Avoided
Collection of Python Scripts and iPython Notebooks (to be used via jupyter notebook IDE) used in the formulation of results for the Study:

Is Arctic Amplification Dominated by Regional Forcing and Feedbacks: Perspectives from the 'World-Avoided' Scenario.

# Preamble notes
- As long as all of these jupyter notebooks are in the same working directory, you shouldn't have to modify the directory paths, and the scripts should work straight away along with the data that is included.
- The .py scripts in /Variable Get Scripts folder require the entire Model output to use. See the acknowledgments section of the study's full text for more information


# Feedback and Misc Calculations
- Here, the scripts that are associated feedbacks derived from the GFDL and ECHAM6 radiative Kernels are NOT included, as they are near identical to the CAM3 scripts provided
- The scripts call upon pickled (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) Climate change responses that were calculated and saved directly from the model output.

# Statistical Significance Scripts
- Same as above, only statistical significance scripts for feedbacks derived from the CAM3 kernels are included here
- Scripts call upon pickled radiative feedback lists

# Plotting Scripts
- These require the pickled files created from the entire model output, available at (TBA).
